I am Bj√∏rn Hoxmark, a passionate Data Scientist currently working at Finn.no in Oslo, Norway. My journey in the world of data began at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) where I earned my Master's degrees in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I did half a year at [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/) in the US and half a year in [University if Modena](https://international.unimore.it/), Italy

At Finn.no, my focus has been on leveraging machine learning and natural language processing to enhance our job matching systems. I have a particular interest in recommender systems and how they can be optimized to provide the most relevant and useful information to users.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at the same company, and before that, at Nordic Semiconductor ASA, where I developed tools for Bluetooth mesh-enabled projects. My technical background is diverse and has given me a foundation in both software development and data science.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies. I believe in continuous learning is important and try to stay up to date on the world of ML which is very fast pace.
